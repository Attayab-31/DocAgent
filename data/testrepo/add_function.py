def analyze_numbers():
    """
    ```
    Analyze numbers and determine if they are above, below, or equal to the average.

    Summary:
        Calculates the average of a list of numbers and checks if each number is above, below, or equal to the average.

    Description:
        This function takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the average, and checks if each number is above, below, or equal to the average. It is useful for analyzing a set of numbers and understanding their distribution. This function can be used in various scenarios such as statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. The function uses the built-in `map`, `sum`, and `len` functions to perform the calculations.

    Args:
        None - The function takes input from the user as a string of numbers separated by spaces.

    Returns:
        None - The function does not return any value, but instead prints the result for each number.

    Raises:
        ValueError - If the input string cannot be converted to a list of floats.

    Examples:
        >>> analyze_numbers('1 2 3 4 5')
        1 is below average
        2 is below average
        3 is below average
        4 is above average
        5 is above average

        >>> analyze_numbers('3 3 3')
        3 is equal to the average
